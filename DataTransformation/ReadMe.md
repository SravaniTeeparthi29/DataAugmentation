# Randomized affine transformations

- Multiple transformations are implemented in this code:
  - Horizontal flip
  - Scale
  - Shear
  - Rotate
  - Translate


* It keeps tracking the original bounding box coordinates of groundtruth and generates the new bounding box after transforming.

* Applying random occlusion.

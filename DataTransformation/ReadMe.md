# Randomized affine transformations

* Multiple transformations are implemented in this code:
  1. Horizontal flip
  2. Scale
  3. Shear
  4. Rotate
  5. Translate


* It keeps tracking the original bounding box coordinates of groundtruth and generates the new bounding box after transforming.

* Applying random occlusion.
